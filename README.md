# CyDriver
The goal of this project is to have RC cars that are controlled by Raspberry Pis.

These cars will be running Node.JS using NPM packages to control the GPIO pins to move the vehicles.

There will be two cars: one will be driven manually, the other will be driven by an artificial neural network.

The neural network will "learn" how to drive on a duct tape course from the manually driven vehicles data.
